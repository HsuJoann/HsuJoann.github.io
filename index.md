Hi! Iâ€™m Joann Hsu. Thanks for stopping by.

I started this blog to share my knowledge and experience of SQL Server and business intelligence several years ago. But technology and tools around us are changing rapidly and my learning has been more diverse than my initial imagination and plans. So, the blog is almost my notebook of what I have learned and found useful in our daily work about data analytics.  I hope the readers of this blog will find the content here is useful and informational. I am here cheering for my readers on their own learning journey. Have FUN!
