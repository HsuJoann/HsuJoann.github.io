I have to say that CoPilot is not good at keeping the history. I have tried so hard to actually show my conversation. Each time, I have failed. 

This is what I said:
copilot: I find that our conversation is very good. I want to share it with my friend and encouage them to use copilot. Please write me a detailed markdown file for all conversation here.

I hope to get one true, not modefied conversation history. No, Copilot tried to summarize and catagorize our conversation. 

In the sense, I like what POE.com did. The conversation there could be so easily shared.

# Example Copilot Chat Session: Building a Chat History System

## Session Overview
**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Topic**: Implementing chat history functionality with GitHub Copilot  
**Tools Used**: VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Python

## Initial Setup

### Getting Voyage API
**Q**: How to get voyage api?

**A**: Here's how to obtain and implement the Voyage API:

1. Visit [Voyage AI's website](https://www.voyageai.com/)
2. Sign up process:
   - Click "Get Started"
   - Create account
   - Verify email
3. Implementation:

```python
VOYAGE_API_KEY="your_actual_key_here"
```

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()
voyage_api_key = os.getenv('VOYAGE_API_KEY')
```

## Chat History Implementation

### Setting Up the Save Chat Function
**Q**: How to save our conversations?

**A**: Created a Python script to handle chat history:

```python
from datetime import datetime
import os
import re

def clean_markdown(text: str) -> str:
    """Clean markdown formatting from text while preserving code blocks."""
    return text.replace('```', '````').strip()

def save_chat_history(question: str, answer: str) -> None:
    """Save chat conversation to CHAT_HISTORY.md including code blocks"""
    chat_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../.github/CHAT_HISTORY.md")
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")
    
    entry = f"""
## Date: {timestamp}
### Question:
{question}

### Answer:
{clean_markdown(answer)}

---
"""
    with open(chat_file, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(entry)
```

### Configuration Setup
**Q**: How to add Copilot instructions?

**A**: Created configuration file:

````yaml
# filepath: /.github/copilot.yml
instructions:
  - "Follow these coding standards:"
  - "Use clear variable names"
  - "Add docstrings"
  - "Include type hints"
  - "Write unit tests"
  - "Save chat history in markdown"
````

## VS Code Integration

### Extension Details
**Q**: What is the latest GitHub Copilot Chat extension?

**A**: Current information:
- Version: 0.12.2024030713
- Requirements:
  - VS Code 1.85.0+
  - Active Copilot subscription
  - GitHub account access

## Running the System

### Terminal Commands
```bash
# Navigate to tools directory
cd c:\your-project\tools

# Run the chat history script
python save_chat.py
```

## Best Practices
1. Store API keys in `.env` files
2. Use proper markdown formatting
3. Implement error handling
4. Document code thoroughly
5. Follow consistent naming conventions

## Code Standards
- Use type hints
- Include docstrings
- Follow PEP 8
- Write unit tests
- Document changes
