## Archive for Virtual PASS Group Meeting


I gave this talk on a PASS Application Development Virtual Group on 2021-10-10 evening. Giving a online presentation is much tougher than giving a in-person presentation because you don't have 
immediate audience feedback. I clearly recall that when I gave in-person presentation, my audience laughed after my openning joke. The laughter relaxed the audience and excited me.
I continued my talk with focus and passion. Online presentation lack on this. But, nevertheless, here is my presentation:


My presentation starts at 9 minutes 30 seconds (before that is the meeting organizer went over group house keeping items)

The knowledge part of my presentation starts at 14 minutes 10 second  (the first 5 minutes of my talk is my self introduction and boring jokes)
