## Charlotte SQL Server User Group Meeting presentation on 2019-07-19 

On July 19, 2019, I gave a presentation call "When SQL meets Python". It was a great experience. The files were on the https://charlotte-sql.org site. but, all attachments were not there after COVID. This post is to archive information about that presentation.
