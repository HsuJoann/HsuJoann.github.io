## Move My Old Blog from Paid WordPress to GitHub

I follow this fabulous blog by Chad Baldwin   (https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). I am very proud of this fellow TSQLer.

For the past several years, I spent about $100 per year to keep my old blog running on Godaddy platform. Since my blog only viewed by people I know, it does not make any sense to keep it that way. GitHub is adopted wildly and is free. So, here I come.

 ```tsql
 SELECT Max(value/cost)
 FROM sys.blog_platform
 
 --Gitbub
 ```
