## Move My Old Blog from Paid WordPress to GitHub

To achieve what I described in the title of this blog, I follow this fabulous blog by Chad Baldwin   (https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). I am super proud of this fellow TSQLer.

For the past several years, I spent about $100 per year to keep my old blog running on Godaddy platform. 
Since my blog only viewed by a few people, it does not make any sense to keep it that way. GitHub is adopted wildly by tech community and it is a better platform. Plus, it is free. So, here I come.

 ```tsql
 SELECT Max(value/cost)
 FROM sys.blog_platform
 
 --Gitbub
 ```


(In case someone is wondering about a best coder way, like export/import. I did not do that. I have about 30 or so posts in my old blog. so, I manually copy/paste everthing. The most none high tech way ðŸ˜Š.  )
