To check if Python is added to your PATH, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal:
   - On Windows: Press Win + R, type "cmd", and press Enter.
   - On macOS or Linux: Open the Terminal application.

2. Type the following command and press Enter: 
   ```
   python --version
   ```

   If Python is installed and added to your PATH, you should see the version number of Python printed in the console. For example:
   ```
   Python 3.9.5
   ```

   If you see an error message like "python is not recognized as an internal or external command" (on Windows) or "command not found: python" (on macOS or Linux), it means Python is not added to your PATH.

3. Alternatively, you can try the following command:
   ```
   python
   ```

   If Python is installed and added to your PATH, it will open the Python interactive shell, and you will see the Python prompt (e.g., `>>>`). You can exit the shell by typing `exit()` or pressing Ctrl + Z followed by Enter (on Windows) or Ctrl + D (on macOS or Linux).

If Python is not added to your PATH, you can follow these steps to add it:

- On Windows:
  1. Open the Start menu, search for "Environment Variables", and click on "Edit the system environment variables".
  2. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
  3. In the "System variables" section, scroll down and find the "Path" variable, then click on "Edit".
  4. Click on "New" and add the path to your Python installation directory (e.g., `C:\Python39`).
  5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

- On macOS or Linux:
  1. Open the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file in your home directory using a text editor.   
     export PATH="/path/to/python:$PATH"
     ```
  3. Save the file and restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.
     export PATH="/path/to/python:$PATH"
     ```
     export PATH="/path/to/python:$PATH"
     export PATH="/path/to/python:$PATH"
     ```
  3. Save the file and restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

After adding Python to your PATH, you can open a new command prompt or terminal and try running the `python --version` command again to verify that Python is now recognized.
